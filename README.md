## Google Sheets CMS with React

- Created a base build of react with webpack and babel 
- webpack has html and sass/scss/css plugins 
- uses a google sheet to add content to be displayed on react UI
- has many potential uses and will expand upon them a bit further in the future
- is done using class component based react, will eventually turn into hooks but need to read the docs a bit further on tabletop.js
- has enzyme for tests also can be expanded upon
